# What's a Student to Do?

TimeTiger is a mobile todo application with a responsive design, built with Firebase. It utilizes Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Hosting to create a seamless user experience.

The application consists of three main steps: Authentication & Registration, Agenda, Project management. Users can keep track of their score on the leaderboard and use a timer to keep track of the time spent on a project.

To get started with this project, you need to set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary authentication and database settings.
